# The Deduplication Notebook

This is a Python [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) that I use for deduplicating folders.

Personally, I do manual backups of my old computers, phones, and other data-storing devices and that leads to a lot of files being saved multiple times.  This notebook allows you to copy a directory to a new location, keeping only the oldest files while recording all file paths for archival purposes.

## Launching the Notebook

To install Jupyter Notebook, run:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

To launch Jupyter Notebook, run in this repo's directory:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
